# Battle-cats-ad-watcher
Watches ads to get catfood in battle cats

This no longer works as Battlecats has limited the amount of ads that you can watch in a day.
This program works by clicking the regions in which the buttons are found. It was made to work with an older version of BlueStacks, but since their UI has changed, it still doesn't work without changing the variables which store the location of the sprites on the screen.

as such, this program is hopelessly broken and won't be fixed until there is some further use for it.

This project -- which I worked on with my friends, [Henry Guo](https://github.com/brepi), [Dominic Miller](https://github.com/finzu0), and [Leo Geppert](https://github.com/Zrfle) -- was done during 9th grade (our online covid year). We all worked on the fundamental base of the code (Pseudocode and how it was going to work) as well as a bit of the real code. Henry Guo finished the coding to make our first two prototypes. Some tweaks were needed as well as much needed efficency boosts, which I implemented later.

This project specifically is THE project that propelled me into computer science and coding. Before I was simply learning code because adults told me it was a good skill to have and that I should learn it, but this program truly showed me how powerful of a tool coding really is. It taught me the essential skills (Googling, Debugging, redoing code to make it more efficient) which I've used almost every single time I've coded.
